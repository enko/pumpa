# Pumpa v0.4

Greetings, fellow pumpkins!

Pumpa is a simple [pump.io][1] client written in C++ and Qt.  Some
parts have been cherry picked from my old StatusNet client, yaics
(<http://gitorious.org/yaics>).

Pumpa is licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0 (or later).  Please send bug
reports and feature suggestions to me via e-mail <mats@sjoberg.fi> or
to my pump.io account [sazius@io.saz.im](https://io.saz.im/sazius).

The [kQOAuth library][2] is copyrighted by [Johan Paul][3] and
licensed under LGPL 2.1.

The [sundown Markdown library][8] is copyrighted by Natacha Porté,
Vicent Marti and others, and [permissively licensed][9].

The current (temporary?) Pumpa logo is from the
["Fruit and Veggie Inventory"][4] entry to the
[Liberated Pixel Cup][5] by Joshua Taylor.  The logo is copyrighted by
the artist and is dual licensed under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license and the
GNU GPL 3.0.

Oh, and "pumpa" just means pumpkin in Swedish :-)

## Build dependencies
  
Pumpa should build with Qt 4.8 or Qt 5.0 or newer. If you are using Qt
4, you will also need the [QJson library][6].

For example on Debian 7.0 "wheezy" the following command should
install everything needed to build the code:

    aptitude install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libqjson-dev

If you want spell checking install the aspell library as well:

    aptitude install libaspell-dev

[6]: http://qjson.sourceforge.net/

## Building

To download and build, type the following:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/pumpa/pumpa.git
    cd pumpa
    qmake-qt4     # or just "qmake" on some systems
    make

The procedure on Mac OS X is the same, but getting the dependencies is
a bit different, David Haberthür has made a detailed guide for
building on Mac OS X here:
<https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/HowTo-for-building-Pumpa-on-OS-X>


## Running

On Linux you can start pumpa by running its binary:

    ./pumpa

On Mac OS X a regular clickable application file (pumpa.app) should be
created.

At first launch an OAuth wizard will pop-up, just enter your pump.io
account id, and click Next. Then a the authentication page with your
pump.io server will be opened in the web browser, just follow the
instructions there. Finally a pair of codes (token, verifier) will
appear that you need to copy & paste back into pumpa.

## Markup

When you are posting a new note or comment you can use [Markdown
syntax][7], with the exception that inline HTML is **not**
allowed. This is because otherwise it would be very easy to add broken
HTML which will be very messy...

## Missing features

There are still several missing features.  This list contains some of
them, not necessarily in order of importance:

* Ability to post images
* Better display of comments' context
* Liking of comments
* Ability to post to a particular user or user list
* Possibly a WYSIWYG post editor (as an option)

Feel free to suggest other features, however my intention is to keep
Pumpa as simple as possible, so I might not be interested in
implementing everything.
