# Pumpa v0.2

Greetings, fellow pumpkins!

Pumpa is a simple (and yet very unfinished) [pump.io][1] client
written in C++ and Qt.  Some parts have been cherry picked from my old
StatusNet client, yaics (<http://gitorious.org/yaics>).

Pumpa is licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0 (or later).  Please send bug
reports and feature suggestions to me via e-mail <mats@sjoberg.fi> or
to my pump.io account [sazius@io.saz.im](https://io.saz.im/sazius).

The current (temporary?) Pumpa logo is from the
["Fruit and Veggie Inventory"][2] entry to the
[Liberated Pixel Cup][3] by Joshua Taylor.  The logo is copyrighted by
the artist and is dual licensed under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license and the
GNU GPL 3.0.

Oh, and "pumpa" just means pumpkin in Swedish :-)

## Build dependencies
  
Pumpa should build with Qt 4.8 or Qt 5.0 or newer. If you are using Qt
4, you will also need the [QJson library][4].

For example on Debian 7.0 "wheezy" the following command should
install everything needed to build the code:

    aptitude install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libqjson-dev

If you want spell checking install the aspell library as well:

    aptitude install libaspell-dev

[4]: http://qjson.sourceforge.net/

## Building

To download and build, type the following:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/pumpa/pumpa.git
    cd pumpa
    qmake-qt4     # or just "qmake" on some systems
    make

The procedure on Mac OS X is the same, but getting the dependencies is
a bit different, David Haberthür has made a detailed guide for
building on Mac OS X here:
<https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/HowTo-for-building-Pumpa-on-OS-X>


## Running

On Linux you can start pumpa by running its binary:

    ./pumpa

On Mac OS X a regular clickable application file (pumpa.app) should be
created.

At first launch an OAuth wizard will pop-up, just enter your pump.io
account id, and click Next. Then a the authentication page with your
pump.io server will be opened in the web browser, just follow the
instructions there. Finally a pair of codes (token, verifier) will
appear that you need to copy & paste back into pumpa.

## Markup

When you are posting a new note or comment a very limited Markdown-inspired syntax is available:

* Surround with * or _ to make an *emphasis*.

* Surround with ** or __ to make a **strong** statement.

* Surround with a back-tick (`` ` ``) for `monospaced text` or two back-ticks

        for pre-formatted
        text 
          like 
             this...


## Missing features

There are a lot of missing features still.  This list contains some of
them, that I almost certainly intend to implement once I get around to
it (not necessarily in order of importance):

* Notification system
* Add a GUI preferences dialog
* Add minimise to tray icon
* Show To: and Cc: fields of notes
* Add ability to see older notes/activities
* Sharing of notes
* Ability to post images
* Images posted as image notes work fine, but images included in
  `<img>` tags in regular notes do not work yet... not sure what to do
  about that...

Feel free to suggest other features, however my intention is to keep
Pumpa as simple as possible, so I might not be interested in
implementing everything.
