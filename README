# Pumpa v0.6

Greetings, fellow pumpkins!

Pumpa is a simple [pump.io][1] client written in C++ and Qt.  Some
parts have been cherry picked from my old StatusNet client, yaics
(<http://gitorious.org/yaics>).

Pumpa is licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0 (or later).  Please send bug
reports and feature suggestions to me via e-mail <mats@sjoberg.fi> or
to my pump.io account [sazius@io.saz.im](https://io.saz.im/sazius).

The [kQOAuth library][2] is copyrighted by [Johan Paul][3] and
licensed under LGPL 2.1.

The [sundown Markdown library][8] is copyrighted by Natacha Porté,
Vicent Marti and others, and [permissively licensed][9].

The current (temporary?) Pumpa logo is from the
["Fruit and Veggie Inventory"][4] entry to the
[Liberated Pixel Cup][5] by Joshua Taylor.  The logo is copyrighted by
the artist and is dual licensed under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license and the
GNU GPL 3.0.

Oh, and "pumpa" is a Swedish word that means either "to pump" (as a
verb) or "pumpkin" (as a noun) :-)

## Build dependencies
  
Pumpa should build with Qt 4.8 or Qt 5.0 or newer. If you are using Qt
4, you will also need the [QJson library][6].

For example on Debian 7.0 "wheezy" the following command should
install everything needed to build the code:

    aptitude install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libqjson-dev

If you want spell checking install the aspell library as well:

    aptitude install libaspell-dev

On Fedora this should install what you need (courtesy of [Dick Turpin][10]):

    yum install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libqjson-dev gcc-c++ qt-devel qt-config qjson-devel

## Building

To download and build, type the following:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/pumpa/pumpa.git
    cd pumpa
    qmake-qt4     # or just "qmake" on some systems
    make

The procedure on Mac OS X is the same, but getting the dependencies is
a bit different, David Haberthür has made a detailed guide for
building on Mac OS X here:
<https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/HowTo-for-building-Pumpa-on-OS-X>


## Running

On Linux you can start pumpa by running its binary:

    ./pumpa

On Mac OS X a regular clickable application file (pumpa.app) should be
created.

At first launch an OAuth wizard will pop-up, just enter your pump.io
account id, and click Next. Then a the authentication page with your
pump.io server will be opened in the web browser, just follow the
instructions there. Finally a pair of codes (token, verifier) will
appear that you need to copy & paste back into pumpa.

## Markup

When you are posting a new note or comment you can use [Markdown
syntax][7], with the exception that inline HTML is **not**
allowed. This is because otherwise it would be very easy to add broken
HTML which will be very messy...

## Configuration

Most features and configuration options should be obvious from the
graphical user interface, but some are a bit hidden.  For example,
while Pumpa doesn't support multiple accounts, you can always start it
with a different configuration file (which can specify another pump.io
account for example) like this:

    ./pumpa -c path_to_alternative.conf

If you are setting up a new account you can give the path to a
non-existent conf-file and Pumpa will run the setup wizard and create
the conf-file for you with the name you specified.

The location of the default configuration file depends on Qt, which
[tries to pick a location that makes sense for your operating system][12].
E.g. in GNU/Linux systems it is typically in:

    ~/.config/pumpa/pumpa.conf

Most configuration options are exposed via the preferences dialog in
Pumpa, except for setting the link colour.  The link colour is
supposed to be automatically set by the theme settings of your desktop
environment, but several people requested a way to override this.

You can add a line like this under the `[%General]` section in the
configuration file:

    link_color=#333

The text after the equals sign can be
[any text string that Qt can parse as a colour][11]. (Yes I know
colour is spelt wrong in the config name :-)

## Missing features

There are still several missing features.  This list contains some of
them, not necessarily in order of importance:

* Posting images
* Ability to post to a particular user or user list

Feel free to suggest other features, however my intention is to keep
Pumpa as simple as possible, so I might not be interested in
implementing everything.
